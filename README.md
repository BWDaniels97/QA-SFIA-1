## About The Project


The main goals for this project were outlined as "To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."

Main Objectives:
* Create a Trello board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion
on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
* Create a relational database used to store data persistently for the
project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it.
* Create clear documentation from the design phase describing the architecture
you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.
* Create a functional CRUD application created in Python.

## My App Idea

My basic app idea consisted of a simple app that allowed the user to add artists to an artists database and then add gigs to a gig database of those said artists.  The app will also let the user dlete gigs and update them.
